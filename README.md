# RateIt

Given an option of many different lists to choose from (NFL teams, Marvel movies, etc.), the user is able to rate them using a merge sort algorithm and then compare their ratings to the global ratings.

COMP 426 Requirements Info:

The backend used was Imgur, which takes the images from when you create a category, and hosts them on imgur instead, so that the loading times will be consistent and the hosting website won't randomly take the images down.

The autocomplete/debouncing is done within the search bar on the home screen.

The backend repository is here:
